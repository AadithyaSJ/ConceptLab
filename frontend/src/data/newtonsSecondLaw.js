  {
    question: "What does Newton's Second Law of Motion state?",
    options: [
      "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.",
      "Force equals mass times acceleration.",
      "An object in motion stays in motion.",
      "Objects fall due to gravity."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Newton’s Second Law states that Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma)."
  },
  {
    question: "If mass is doubled and acceleration is constant, what happens to the force?",
    options: [
      "Force remains the same",
      "Force doubles",
      "Force halves",
      "Force becomes zero"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Since F = ma, doubling mass doubles the force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which unit measures force?",
    options: ["Joule", "Watt", "Newton", "Pascal"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Force is measured in Newtons (N)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if net force on an object is zero?",
    options: [
      "It accelerates",
      "It stops",
      "It remains at constant velocity",
      "It explodes"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Zero net force means constant velocity or rest — no acceleration."
  },
  {
    question: "If acceleration increases with same mass, what happens to force?",
    options: [
      "It decreases",
      "It remains same",
      "It increases",
      "It becomes zero"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "F = ma. Increasing acceleration increases force."
