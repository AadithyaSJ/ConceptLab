    question: "The line hitting the surface is the:",
    options: ["Normal", "Incident ray", "Reflected ray"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Incident ray is the incoming light."
  },
  {
    question: "Mirrors are used because:",
    options: ["They absorb light", "They scatter light", "They reflect light"],
    correct: 2,
