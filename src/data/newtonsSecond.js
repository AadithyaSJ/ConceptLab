    options: ["0", "1000 N", "500 N"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Constant velocity means no net force."

  {
    question: "What does a net force cause?",
    options: ["Change in temperature", "Change in acceleration", "Change in mass"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "F = ma: net force causes acceleration."

    options: ["5 kg", "2 kg", "10 kg"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "m = F/a = 20/4 = 5 kg."

  {
    question: "Which of these shows no acceleration?",
    options: ["Object at rest with no force", "Object with increasing velocity", "Object being pushed"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "No net force → no acceleration."
  },
  {
    question: "More mass means:",
    options: ["More acceleration", "Less acceleration for same force", "Less force needed"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "a = F/m: more mass → less acceleration."
