    options: ["Zero", "Max", "Constant"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Ideal springs have no energy loss."
  },
  {
    question: "Slope of Force-Displacement graph is:",
    options: ["Velocity", "k", "Mass"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "F = kx, slope = k."
  },
  {
    question: "If spring is compressed, x is:",
    options: ["Positive", "Zero", "Negative"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Compression is negative displacement."

    options: ["50 N/m", "5 N/m", "12.5 N/m"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "k = F/x = 25/0.5 = 50 N/m."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens beyond elastic limit?",
    options: ["Permanent deformation", "Oscillation", "Vibration"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Beyond elastic limit, spring doesn't return to original shape."
  },
  {
    question: "At max extension, acceleration is:",
    options: ["Max", "Zero", "Constant"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Restoring force is maximum at max extension."
