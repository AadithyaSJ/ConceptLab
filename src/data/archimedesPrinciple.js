    question: "What does Archimedes’ Principle state?",
    options: ["An object floats if it is heavy", "Buoyant force equals weight of displaced fluid", "Density equals mass times volume"],
    correct: 1,

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Buoyant force depends on volume of fluid displaced."

  {
    question: "Floating occurs when:",
    options: ["Buoyant force < weight", "Buoyant force = weight", "Buoyant force > weight"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Object floats when buoyant force is greater than its weight."
  },
  {
    question: "A denser object than water will:",
    options: ["Float", "Sink", "Stay suspended"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "It sinks because weight > buoyant force."
  },
  {
    question: "What does fluid density affect?",
    options: ["Color of object", "Buoyant force", "Mass"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Higher fluid density means more buoyant force."
  },
  {
    question: "When will an object float?",
    options: ["Density = fluid", "Density < fluid", "Density > fluid"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Less dense objects float."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is an application of Archimedes’ Principle?",
    options: ["Airplane lift", "Rocket propulsion", "Submarine buoyancy"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Submarines use buoyancy to sink and rise."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a ship float?",
    options: ["Made of wood", "Hollow shape displaces more water", "It's light"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Large volume displaces more water = greater buoyant force."
  },
  {
    question: "Archimedes discovered his principle while:",
    options: ["Running", "Bathing", "Cooking"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "He noticed water overflow while bathing."
  },
  {
    question: "Buoyant force acts in which direction?",
    options: ["Downward", "Sideways", "Upward"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Buoyant force pushes up."
  },
  {
    question: "What is displaced by a submerged object?",
    options: ["Weight", "Liquid", "Force"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "It displaces an equal volume of liquid."
  },
  {
    question: "More volume submerged means:",
    options: ["More buoyant force", "Less buoyant force", "No change"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "More fluid displaced = more upward force."
  },
  {
    question: "What increases buoyant force?",
    options: ["Shape of object", "Density of liquid", "Temperature of object"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Higher liquid density means more force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which object experiences least buoyancy?",
    options: ["Lead ball", "Wooden log", "Plastic bottle"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Lead sinks easily due to high density."
  },
  {
    question: "If object sinks, buoyant force is:",
    options: ["Greater than weight", "Equal to weight", "Less than weight"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Sinks because weight > buoyant force."
  },
  {
    question: "Fluid pressure increases with:",
    options: ["Height", "Depth", "Temperature"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Pressure rises with depth, increasing buoyant force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which liquid gives more buoyancy?",
    options: ["Saltwater", "Freshwater", "Alcohol"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Saltwater is denser, gives more lift."
  },
  {
    question: "Object feels lighter in water due to:",
    options: ["Less gravity", "Less mass", "Buoyant force"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Buoyant force reduces effective weight."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do icebergs float?",
    options: ["Low temperature", "Lower density than water", "High volume"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Ice is less dense than water."
  },
  {
    question: "Archimedes’ Principle is used in:",
    options: ["Measuring pressure", "Measuring volume", "Finding density"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "We can calculate density using fluid displacement."
  },
  {
    question: "Object partially submerged has:",
    options: ["Zero buoyant force", "Some buoyant force", "Infinite buoyant force"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Partial volume still displaces fluid."
  },
  {
    question: "Cork floats in water because:",
    options: ["It is soft", "It is less dense", "It is light-colored"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Lower density causes floatation."
  },
  {
    question: "Volume of displaced fluid depends on:",
    options: ["Mass of object", "Material", "Submerged volume"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Only the submerged volume matters."
